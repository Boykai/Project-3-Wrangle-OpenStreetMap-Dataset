# Project-3-Wrangle-OpenStreetMap-Dataset
Wrangle OpenStreetMap data using MongoDB within a Python environment

## Introduction
You will choose any area of the world in [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about. Finally, you will choose either MongoDB or SQL as the data schema to complete your project. [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/25/view)
